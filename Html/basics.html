Doctype
    HTML documents must start with a <!DOCTYPE> declaration.
    It is an "information" to the browser about what document type to expect
    eg
    <!DOCTYPE html> // html5 document


What if browser  does not support html5?
    browser will simply ignore that tag, it won't throw any error.


Websocket
    Websocket is two way communication technology for web applications
     which operates over a single socket and is exposed via a JavaScript interface
     in HTML 5 compatible browsers
    Eg
    // Create javascript function to work with socket
    function WebSocketTest() {}
    // Check if browser supports Websocket
    if ("WebSocket" in window){}
    // open Websocket
    var ws = new WebSocket("ws://localhost:9998/echo");
    // open handler
    ws.onopen = function() { }; // we can inform user that connection is successfull
    // send message using send method
    ws.send("Message to send")
    // recieve message handler, we recieve event we can access data property of event
    ws.onmessage = function(evt) { evt.data}
    // connection close handler
    ws.onclose = function() {} // inform user that connection is closed with Websocket
    // close connection using close() method
    ws.close();



Webworkers
A web worker is a JavaScript running in the background, without affecting the performance of the page.
    // check if browser supports Webworkers
    if (typeof(Worker) !== "undefined")
    // create javascript external file
    suppose demo-worker.js
    // Create a Web Worker Object
    let ww = new Worker("demo_workers.js");
    // Stop Webworkers
    ww.terminate()
    // recieve data in main thread from worker file
    ww.onmessage = function(event) {
      event.data;
    };
    // send data from worker file after computation done using postMessage()
    postMessage(computationResult);
    // Send data from main thread to worker file
    ww.postMessage("message from main thread")'
    // recieve message handler in worker file
    onmessage = function(evt) {
        const dataFromMainThread =evt.data
    }
There are shared worker also



SSE - One Way Messaging
Server-Sent Events (SSE) allow a web page to get updates from a server
var source = new EventSource("demo_sse.php");
source.onmessage = function(event) {
  document.getElementById("result").innerHTML += event.data + "<br>";
};
// Methods
    1 - onopen // when connection established
    2 - onmessage // when message recieve
    3 - onerror // when error occurs



Symantic tags means elements with a meaning, and decribes about its content
    A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer.
    Eg
    <form>, <table>, and <article>
    non-semantic elements: <div> and <span> - Tells nothing about its content.

Block vs inline tags
    HTML element has a default display value, depending on what type of element it is.
    A block-level element always starts on a new line,
     and the browsers automatically add some space (a margin) before and after the element.
    A block-level element always takes up the full width available
    Eg
    div, p

    An inline element does not start on a new line.
    An inline element only takes up as much width as necessary
    Eg
    span


Web storages, local and session
web storage, web applications can store data locally within the user's browser
Web storage is more secure, and large amounts (at least 5MB) of data can be stored locally,
 without affecting website performance.
    localStorage - stores data with no expiration date
    // Store
    localStorage.setItem("lastname", "Smith");
    // Retrieve
    localStorage.getItem("lastname");
    // Remove  item
    localStorage.removeItem("lastname");
    // Clear localStorage
    localStorage.clear()

    sessionStorage - data is lost when the browser tab is closed


Tags vs elements and void element
    HTML element is defined by a start tag, some content, and an end tag.
    HTML elements can be nested
    Tag is part of element and tags can be start tag and end tag


Html entities
    Reserved characters in HTML must be replaced with character entities.
    If you use the less than (<) or greater than (>) signs in your text
    Syntax: &entity_name; // start with & and ends with the ;and between them entity name
    Eg: &lt; &nbsp;

multipart/form-data
    Multipart/form-data is one of the most used enctype/content type.
    When you make a POST request, you have to encode the data that forms the body of the request
    We have to use multipart/form-data when your form includes any <input type="file"> elements
    Eg: enctype = "multipart/form-data"


types of lists
    Unordered, Ordered, Description lists,
    1. ul, li, // css list-style-type: [disc, circle, square, none]
    2. ol, li, // attribute type="1", "A", "a", "i", "I"
    3. dl - defined description list container
        dt - description term
        dd - description of term in description list (while rendering use left padding)



HTML5 Advantages
    1. Cleaner markup/ Improved code:
    HTML5 will enable web designers to use cleaner, neater code.
     We can remove div tags and replace them with semantic HTML5 elements.
    2. Elegant forms:
    HTML5 enables designer to use fancier forms.
     There will be different type of inputs, search and different fields for different purpose.
    3. Consistance
    consistency in terms of HTML used to code a web page on one site compared to another
    4. Supports rich media elements:
    HTML5 has an inbuilt capability to play audio and video and so we can say goodbye
     to those plugin tags.
    5. Offline Application Cache:
    HTML5 offers an offline application cache facility
     which will load the page the user has visited even if the user is temporarily offline.

Audio and Video Tags
    <audio> used to play an audio file on a web page.
    Eg
    <audio controls autoplay muted>
        <source src="horse.ogg" type="audio/ogg">
        <source src="horse.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
        Your browser does not support the audio element.
    </audio>
    // control attribute
    controls attribute adds audio controls, like play, pause, and volume.
    // autoplay
    audio start playing automatically
    // muted
    audio muted while playing, we can eneble bu using volume control
    // source 
    <source> element allows you to specify alternative audio files
    it will pick supported one,
    if audio doesn't support in browser render text

    <video> used to show a video on a web page.
    video has same attributs and behaves same as audio
    In addition video has width and height attributes to render vdo player size

mark tag
    Marks or highlights text works as span with yellow background color

figure, figcaption
    <figure> element to mark up a photo in a document,
      and a <figcaption> element to define a caption for the photo:
    Eg
    <figure>
        <img src="pic_trulli.jpg" alt="Trulli" style="width:100%">
        <figcaption>Fig.1 - Trulli, Puglia, Italy.</figcaption>
    </figure>

datalist vs select
    In select we have to select item from given options. It hase optiongroup tag  to support grouping
    But in data list we can select option as well as we can enter any text
     Id data list we do not have optiongroup
    Select - select, option, optiongroup
    Datalist- we have to create one input having list attribute
        list attribute value will be id of datalist
        datalist, option
        Eg
        <input type="text" list="Gender">
        <datalist id="Gender">
            <option value="Male">
            <option value="Female"> 
        </datalist>

meter vs progress
    <progress> is used to convey how much work in a task has been completed,
     the <meter> element is used to display a measurement on a known scale.
    We can think that progress value will be dynamic and it will change as per the progress of task
    meter is used to show static values of scales eg. disk usage, it has mix and max value
    eg
    <meter id="disk_c" value="2" min="0" max="10">2 out of 10</meter><br>
    <meter id="disk_d" value="0.6">60%</meter>

HTML graphics
svg and canvas
    We can render different types of graphics in webpage using canvar and svg

make image responsive
    Using height: auto and width: 100% or fixed value will make images responsive

media elemets in html5, audio, video, embed, source, track


object embed
    Both the <embed> and <object> tags are used to load external plugin content
    embed is deprecated
     embed use src attribute for multimedia object
     Object tag uses data attribute
    Both takes height width
    both takes type to define type of data or src file
    eg // load pdf file
    <object type="application/pdf"
            data="data/uploads/media/default/0001/01/540cb75550adf33f281f29132dddd14fded85bfc.pdf"  
            width="300" 
            height="200">
      <a href="/uploads/media/default/0001/01/540cb75550adf33f281f29132dddd14fded85bfc.pdf">download pdf</a>
    </object>
    or // play youtube video
    <object width="320" height="240" data="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bZNEB_o3Hzw?ecver=2">
    </object>


novalidate
    When present, it specifies that the form-data (input) should not perform html validations
     when submitted.

noscript
    <noscript> HTML element defines a section of HTML to be inserted
     if a script type on the page is unsupported or if scripting is currently turned off in the browser.

pollyfills
    A polyfill is a piece of code (or plugin) that provides the technology that the developer,
     expect the browser to provide natively.


Iframes
    <iframe> tag specifies an inline frame.
    used to embed another document within the current HTML document.
    src - specify url
    srcdoc - specify html code to render in iframe
    height and width

while playing youtube video via html multiledia we can append few queryparam to youtube url
 for specific purpose
    eg. mute=1 // will mute video
    autoplay=1 // autoplay video on page rendering

For PWA we use manifest.json and serviceWorker.js file
    in manifest file, we store name, short_name, icons, start_url
    serviceWorker will cache the resources
    // This is overview

geolocation api
    HTML5 API used to Locate the User's Position
    User should approve location access 
    // Check if browser supports grolocation
    if (navigator.geolocation)
    // getCurrentPosition() method to get current coordination
    navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(showPosition);
    // watchPosition() Method to watch current coordination as user moves
    navigator.geolocation.watchPosition(showPosition);
    // clearWatch() to stop accessing current position
    navigator.geolocation.clearWatch();

    Both method takes a callback function which will retrive latitude and longitude
     using position object
    function showPosition(position) {
        position.coords.latitude;
        position.coords.longitude;
    }


New input types
    in html5 added new input types to record data from user
    color, date, datetime-local, email, month, number, range, search, tel, time, url, week

Drag n drop
    any element can be dragged and dropped.
    draggable="true", ondragstart="drag(event)" // on draggable item
    ondrop="drop(event)", ondragover="allowDrop(event)" // on drop container
    // Make element draggable
    draggable="true"
    // set data when drag start event occurrs
    ondragstart="drag(event)"
    function drag(ev) {
        ev.dataTransfer.setData("text", ev.target.id);
    }
    // in droppable element ondragover event occurrs
    ondragover="allowDrop(event)"
    function allowDrop(event) {
        event.preventDefault()
    }
    // ondrop event when drop complets
    function drop(ev) {
        ev.preventDefault();
        var data = ev.dataTransfer.getData("text");
        ev.target.appendChild(document.getElementById(data));
    }


Formatting Elements
