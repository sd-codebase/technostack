What if browser  does not support html5?
    browser will simply ignore that tag, it won't throw any error.


Websocket
    Websocket is two way communication technology for web applications
     which operates over a single socket and is exposed via a JavaScript interface
     in HTML 5 compatible browsers
    Eg
    // Create javascript function to work with socket
    function WebSocketTest() {}
    // Check if browser supports Websocket
    if ("WebSocket" in window){}
    // open Websocket
    var ws = new WebSocket("ws://localhost:9998/echo");
    // open handler
    ws.onopen = function() { }; // we can inform user that connection is successfull
    // send message using send method
    ws.send("Message to send")
    // recieve message handler, we recieve event we can access data property of event
    ws.onmessage = function(evt) { evt.data}
    // connection close handler
    ws.onclose = function() {} // inform user that connection is closed with Websocket
    // close connection using close() method
    ws.close();



Webworkers
A web worker is a JavaScript running in the background, without affecting the performance of the page.
    // check if browser supports Webworkers
    if (typeof(Worker) !== "undefined")
    // create javascript external file
    suppose demo-worker.js
    // Create a Web Worker Object
    let ww = new Worker("demo_workers.js");
    // Stop Webworkers
    ww.terminate()
    // recieve data in main thread from worker file
    ww.onmessage = function(event) {
      event.data;
    };
    // send data from worker file after computation done using postMessage()
    postMessage(computationResult);
    // Send data from main thread to worker file
    ww.postMessage("message from main thread")'
    // recieve message handler in worker file
    onmessage = function(evt) {
        const dataFromMainThread =evt.data
    }
There are shared worker also



SSE - One Way Messaging
Server-Sent Events (SSE) allow a web page to get updates from a server
var source = new EventSource("demo_sse.php");
source.onmessage = function(event) {
  document.getElementById("result").innerHTML += event.data + "<br>";
};
// Methods
    1 - onopen // when connection established
    2 - onmessage // when message recieve
    3 - onerror // when error occurs



Symantic tags means elements with a meaning, and decribes about its content
    A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer.
    Eg
    <form>, <table>, and <article>
    non-semantic elements: <div> and <span> - Tells nothing about its content.

Block vs inline tags
    HTML element has a default display value, depending on what type of element it is.
    A block-level element always starts on a new line, and the browsers automatically add some space (a margin) before and after the element.
    A block-level element always takes up the full width available
    Eg
    div, p

    An inline element does not start on a new line.
    An inline element only takes up as much width as necessary
    Eg
    span


Web storages, local and session
web storage, web applications can store data locally within the user's browser
Web storage is more secure, and large amounts (at least 5MB) of data can be stored locally, without affecting website performance.
    localStorage - stores data with no expiration date
    // Store
    localStorage.setItem("lastname", "Smith");
    // Retrieve
    localStorage.getItem("lastname");
    // Remove  item
    localStorage.removeItem("lastname");
    // Clear localStorage
    localStorage.clear()

    sessionStorage - data is lost when the browser tab is closed


Tags vs elements and void element
    HTML element is defined by a start tag, some content, and an end tag.
    HTML elements can be nested
    Tag is part of element and tags can be start tag and end tag


Html entities
    Reserved characters in HTML must be replaced with character entities.
    If you use the less than (<) or greater than (>) signs in your text
    Syntax: &entity_name; // start with & and ends with the ;and between them entity name
    Eg: &lt; &nbsp;

multipart/form-data
    Multipart/form-data is one of the most used enctype/content type.
    When you make a POST request, you have to encode the data that forms the body of the request
    We have to use multipart/form-data when your form includes any <input type="file"> elements
    Eg: enctype = "multipart/form-data"
