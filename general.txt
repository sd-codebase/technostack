Why typescript over javascript
	Ts is superset of js
	TypeScript always points out the compilation errors at the time of development (pre-compilation)
	Typescript is JavaScript with static typing

async/defer script
	Normally browser parses html and render UI, when an script tag occurs in html, browser stops parsing document and execute scripts
	This way it blocks rendering, once js script finish executing, browser start parsing and rendring
	By adding defer or async we instruct browser to not wait for script execution, 
	Browser will render UI as well as load the script in background.
	Async/defer
	Both used to load script in background. There is only one difference in async and defer, defer will load all script and then browser will execute defer script one by one same as sequence they are written in html markup
	Async will start immediate execution if any script loaded successfully, async doesn't wait to finish all script to load.

Why angular?
	Angular is a highly popular web development framework that offers rich user experiences, fast responsiveness, and code maintainability.
	Supported by Google
	Uses Typescript
	Makes PWa and SPA's supports for SEO using SSR
	Good testing support, supports TDD
