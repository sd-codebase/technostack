Intro-
We can create any kind of form using template-driven form in angular
Template-driven forms use two-way data binding to update the data model in component as we update data in template or vice a versa i.e view will get updated if we update data in component
we use ngModel for two way data binding.

Here we will see template driven form in 3 steps
1- creating form
2- validate data 
3- fetch updated data through forms

First we need to import FormsModule in out NgModule, as we can see here we have imported FormsModule
Then we have created data model in our component i.e. model property. Which consists of fname and lname
And we have form submission handler i.e onSubmit method, which will log data updated through our template form

Then we come to important part of template driven form is template itself
Here we have created form with one submit event and one reference to our form i.e myForm
We have added 2 input field for first name and last name
Both are required field, we have bind data using ngModel. and we have references for each form control i.e. fname and lname
We have added validation errormessage for each field, it will be visible if the respective field is invalid. means it hide if field is valid or not yet updated i.e pristine
We have added one sumbit button, and made it disabled if form is invalid

After valid form sumbission we have logged data in our component.
