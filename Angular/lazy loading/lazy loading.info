Intro-
You can configure your routes to lazy load modules, which means that Angular only loads modules as needed, rather than loading all modules when the application launches.
Lazy loading helps keep initial bundle sizes smaller, which in turn helps decrease load times
Now we are going to see how to configure lazily loaded modules in Routes


Conclude
forRoot() and forChild() methods. 
To configure routes in root module angular uses forRoot() method
And To configure routes in feature module angular uses forChild() method which takes routes array as argument
As Angular application has one root module and a number of featuremodule. 
In same way in angular application forRoot() method can be use only once, and forChild() can be used many times as we need
